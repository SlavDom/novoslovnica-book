\section{Person}

This grammar category determines the person who is spoken about. There are three points of view: the point of the speaker (First person), the point of the interlocutor (Second person) and the point of other persons, that are not involved into discussion (Third person).

That is how slavic discussion could be seen. Practically, this concept is similar to all european languages, particularly English. We have a total equivalency with English in Novoslovnica, so this paragraph will be very short.
