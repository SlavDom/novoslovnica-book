Predicative\index{predicative} is a POS that is closely deriving to the predicate. Formally, it is an adverb that plays the role of the predicate (concluded in the predicate as a part of it). 

You should divide a syntax and morphological definitions of predicative. Now we are talking about the second one. In russian philology you can find the term of “condition category” - the equivalent for predicative (morphological definition). In this paragraph we will speak just about this term.

Predicative determines the class of words indicating an attribute or a condition of a person, environment etc., especially mental. Predicatives cannot be alternated, though they can be differentiated by tenses using an auxiliary verb “to be”. 

Predicatives have homonyms with adverbs, and nouns.
