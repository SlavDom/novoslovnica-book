\chapter{Phonology}

Every language has its own phonology. But do you know what phonology is?

Phonology - a branch of linguistics concerned with the systematic organization of sounds in the language.

Thus, phonology describes all the sounds that the language possesses. Sounds can be divided into different classes. One of the characteristics separating different sounds is the ability to pronounce them with an open vocal tract. You can notice that vowels (such as a, o, u in English) are able to be pronounced with open vocal tract, whereas consonants are pronounced with partly or completely closed vocal tract. So, let's discuss the sounds from the point of this classification.

However, firstly we should speak about the term allophone.

Allophone - one of a set of multiple possible spoken sounds or signs used to pronounce a single phoneme in a particular language.

Well, what is a phoneme? A phoneme is one of the units of sound that distinguish one word from another in a particular language. Simply put, it is such a sound (or a set of sounds) that do not influence the meaning of the word.
