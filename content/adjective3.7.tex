\section{Adjective}

% Table

Adjective is one of POS that determines an attribute of the concept. There are two types of adjectives - relative and qualitative. 

Relative adjectives are called so, because they show relations between two concepts or a concept and an action.
Examples:
South (adj) pole = South (noun) <= relation <= Pole
Južnyǐ pôl = Jug <= relation <= Pôl

Qualitative adjectives are called so, because they show the quality of a concept’s property. This quality could be relative or quantitative or purely qualitative (showing concept condition, position, measure etc)
Examples:

There is the only type of adjective declension. However, we will divide declension tables by gender and base softness.
