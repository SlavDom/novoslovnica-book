\chapter{Grammar}

To begin with I would like to say that grammar is the core of every language. Grammar comprises different themes that are united in a system of changing words enough for building sensible syntax constructions. We will look at Novoslovnica grammar from the point of Parts of Speech.

Part of speech (POS) - is a category of words which have similar grammatical properties.

Thus we unite some words into parts of speech when there are a lot of similar grammar properties, such as “number”, “person”, “case”, “tense” etc. In this chapter we will go through different parts of speech and study what differences they have and how we should deal with them. 

POS have two main categories - independent parts of speech and auxiliary parts of speech. Why some of POS are auxiliary or independent? This refers to their semantic values. Independent POS have a full semantic value. Auxiliary have not. What it means: when you say a word of an independent POS you reproduce some meaning that the interlocutor can recognize.

\textbf{Example:}

\textit{River} - this word can be recognized by interlocutor as some concept of water flowing in a restricted area.

\textit{Beautiful} - this word is recognizable as an attribute of any concept that is nice, pleasant to the person (i.e. speaker or interlocutor)

\textit{Came} - this word can be recognized as any concept’s action of going to the destination point and having reached it. 

And so on. You see that every word has its own meaning, rather full to imagine yourself some information you have been received. This is not true for auxiliary POS. For example, words “and” or “to” cannot give you any map in your mind into any sensible meanings. Though these words have no determined sense itselves, they are extremely important in the whole phrase. English language is an analytical one, that’s why words are mostly connected with each other in the phrase by auxiliary POS. Without them you cannot understand, what the person have said to you. Slavic languages are fusional, but there are enough analytic features in them, hence auxiliary POS are also important.

Also there are two additional categories - particles and interjections. Some allocate them into separate categories, some claim they belong to an auxiliary category. Nevertheless, these are separated POS that have different properties.

Particles add to words they are close to some additional functions. If you delete them from your phrase, there will be no change in the whole meaning (that’s why I cannot say they are an auxiliary ones), but with presence of particles you will get more semantic or emotional information. English language has very few particles. The most known is “to” as an infinitive indicator particle of a verb. Controversially, Slavic languages have a bit more particles, that are rather popular in the spoken language. 

\textbf{Examples:}

\textit{Ja sům govoril tobě. }- I have told you.

\textit{Ja sům govoril že tobě!} - I have told you! (Additional semantic meaning. The speaker shifts emphasis from undefined to the word “govoril” (told). So the interlocutor now have a determined emphasis of the phrase. The speaker wants to say that he has already told the same fact to the interlocutor and his idea has become true just now.) 

Interjection is a POS that have no semantic meanings. They are not words in over common comprehension. Interjections are sounds that we produce. It is rather difficult to say sometimes what differences are between interjections and senseless sounds that we can produce (i.e. some spontaneous exclaims, murmuring etc.) Interjections are divided into intended exclaims (with bright emotional color) and sound imitations (i.e. animal voices imitation).

These are categories of POS. If we speak about independent POS, we should take into account that there are different semantic, morphological and syntax functions can be described by these POS. There several type of these functions: the concept, the attribute, the predicate and the demonstrative.

The concept is something that correlates with the object or subject in the real world. It could be either abstract or imaginary, but we can ask a questions “Who? What?” about it.

The predicate is something that determines the action, corresponding to a concept. We often ask questions “What to do?” to reveal a predicate.

The attribute is something that is correspond to a concept or an action. We ask questions “What concept is like?” or “What action is like?” to find out the determine value of the attribute.

The demonstrative points out the concept. It has the same question with the attribute, yet has no semantic value but demonstrating a concept it corresponds with. 

POS with concept properties are Nouns and Cardinal Numerals. POS with attribute properties are Adjectives. Ordinal Numerals and Adverbs. POS with action properties are Verbs, Participles, Gerund. POS with demonstrative attributes are Pronouns.

Thus Noun, Adjective, Verb, Adverb, Numeral, Pronoun, Gerund, Participle are independent while Preposition, Particle, Interjection, Conjunction are auxiliary.

The last division of independent POS is nominal/verbal. It is extremely important, because this division shows differences in grammar of nominal and verbal POS. Verb, Participle, Gerund are verbal POS while Noun, Adjective, Numeral are nominal. Adverbs and pronouns stay separately - the first one because of its immutability and the second one because of its heterogeneity. 

In this chapter we will speak about every POS I have listed above. In the beginning of each paragraph I will give you a table of some kind of property description of the POS.

First you should know some facts about different grammatical properties in Novoslovnica.
