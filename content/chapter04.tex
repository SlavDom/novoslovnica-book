\chapter{Phrase}

Phrase, or collocation, is a semantic and grammar union of some words. Usually we speak about 2-5 words in a collocation. The phrase always has the main word and dependent words. They are connected with each other by some kinds of links. They are: Coherence, Management and Adjunction.

The word with a coherence link is of the same grammar form as the main word. That means, if we change the main word (i.e. the case), we will have to change also the form of the word with a coherence link.

The word with a management link has a determined grammar form. So, if we have the main word and the word we want to connect to it, we should once change grammar form of a dependent word with the rule-case of the management link and then, when we change form of the main word, we will keep the form of the dependent one.

Adjunction link means that we simply add a dependent word to our collocation. We usually speak about this type of linking when we have immutable words.

Here you should remember what we have spoken about cases in the previous chapter. Using the proper case in a collocation is a great mean of constructing a euphonious and understandable sentence. However, we cannot define all the cases of such links, so you can feel-in the language to achieve this art. If you are a Slav, simply try to use those cases that you use in your native language.
