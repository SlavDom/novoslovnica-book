% И and І 
Many people will surely be confused by these two letters. They will ask whether there is the rule when we need to write the first ot the second one. However, you should look up and remember that these both letters produce different sounds. And that is the point. 

The first letter produces the soft sound “I” while the second one stands for the hard sound. But the question is, where there are used such sounds? It is a very difficult question, because we can write the rule for the roots, where these letters both can be found. However, we can list some prefixes and suffixes that contain the soft or the hard letter.
