\section{Emphasis}

Emphasis is a logical accent in a phrase. Often we allocate the accented words with the voice while speaking, but sometimes we need to show the accent in writing or strongify it. So here you can take a look at tools of showing the accent in your phrase.

The most suitable way of it is to use particles “že”, “ž”, “pretož”, “vědj”. The accent depends on place where the particle stands in your sentence. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item In the beginning - this makes the accent on the first word in a phrase (sentence)
	\item After the first word - this makes the accent on the whole phrase (sentence)
	\item After the second … last word - this makes the accent on the second … last word in your phrase (sentence)
\end{itemize}
