\chapter{Acknowledgements}

Starting this book I would like to appreciate some persons who had a great influence on me while writing the book. Such a work never can be done with an effort of a single man. I am grateful to those who believed in the project for a whole development period or for a while.

First of all I want to thank Rafail Gasparyan. I suppose without his help and collaboration this book would have never been finished. And maybe so Novoslovnica would have.

I would like to thank my Macedonian friend Kristijan Cvetabovski. His trust in Novoslovnica made me continue my work for all these years. And with the help of him I discover some important points that shake the grounds of the project a bit of times.

I want to thank my American friend Harris Mowbray and my Belarusian friend Sergey Yanchenko for editing English and Russian text of the work respectively.

Also I want to thank my Czech colleague Vojтěh Merunka for his critical view on this project. This made me rethink an amount of language details. Without that I don't believe Novoslovnica would have ever become a serious project. 

Moreover, I would like to appreciate persons that keep the inspiration inside me for these years: Manol Terziev (Bulgaria), Alexandra Getsich (Serbia), Ljiljana Bradich (Serbia).
