\chapter{Semantics}

There are three main parts of the sentence analysis that lead us to understanding: grammar, syntax and semantics. First two chapters were reviewed on the previous pages of the book. Here we are going to talk about the third main part of the linguistic analysis - Semantics.

We are not talking here about how to produce something like machine-assisted translator of Novoslovnica. However, we will consider some facts, that could help to deal with it. 

This chapter comprises three parts: the semantics of prefixes, the semantics of suffixes and common semantics that will describe the sense of roots and dependent \gls{pos}.
