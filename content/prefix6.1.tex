\section{Prefix}

\newglossaryentry{pow}{name=POW, description={Part of word}}

Prefix\index{prefix} is a part of a word (\gls{pow}) that stands before the word stem. One word may have more than one prefix. In other words, prefixes can be placed one by one right to the beginning of the stem. Each prefix has its own semantic value and word changes its meaning due to presence of exact prefixes.

We can divide prefixes into several groups. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Borrowed - prefixes that were borrowed from other languages (i.e. Latin, English etc.)
	\item Native - Slavic prefixes, that have a clear semantic value
\end{itemize}

Novoslovnica possesses XX native\index{prefix!native} and XX borrowed\index{prefix!borrowed} prefixes.

Native: bez, v, vně, vųtrě, voz, vy, do, za, zad, iz, k, kų, među, na, nad, naǐ, ne, ni, o, od, pa, po, pod, poslě, pra, pre, pred, prez, pri, pro, råz, s, sô, u, črez.

Borrowed: a, antï, aŭto, kŭazï, mono, multï, pan, para, super

The chapter is to discuss the main prefixes, giving each of them a description and examples. Also one should consider that major part of prefixes are deeply connected with the prepositions. That means many prefixes can be used separately from the stem in a prepositional role. Such prefixes are marked with the PREP label. 

\textbf{Bez} PREP

Meaning: “without”

This prefix is an equivalent of the word “without” in English. It means the absence of something that we mention. As a prefix, it has no equivalence in English. Nevertheless, the suffix “-less” has a very similar meaning. Look at the example to get it.

\textbf{Examples:}

\textit{Bez doma} - Without home

\textit{Bezdušen} - Without soul/Soulless 


\textbf{V} PREP
