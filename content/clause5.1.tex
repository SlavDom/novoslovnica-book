\section{Clause}

A clause is the smallest grammatical unit that represents a complete proposition. An ordinary clause consists of a NP and VP.

NP, or Noun (Nominal) Phrase, is a construction into which nouns most commonly enter, and of which they are the head word. \cite{lang-dict}

VP, or Verb Phrase, has two senses \cite{lang-dict}. In common sense, it refers to a group of verbs that describes a predicate in a sentense, i.e. is coming, have been bought, may enter. One of these verbs is the main verb (lexical) and the others are auxiliary (subordinating). In generative grammr, VP refers to a whole predicate of a sentence. Thus, sentence S is describes as a sum of NP and VP (S = NP + VP). In this terms, a sentence consists of a subject represented by NP and a predicate represented by VP.

The subject determines the concept which is the actor in the sentence and the predicate determines the action which the actor is connected with.
