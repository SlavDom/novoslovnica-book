\section{Clause}

Clause is the smallest grammatical unit that represents a complete proposition. An ordinary clause consists of a subject and a predicate, sometimes with some additional auxiliary members. Predicate usually is composed of a verb with adverbial modifiers.

The subject determines the concept which is the actor in the sentence and the predicate determines the action which the actor is connected with.
