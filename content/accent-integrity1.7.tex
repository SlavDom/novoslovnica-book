\section{Accent Integrity}

There is also one term, that you should to know when you use Novoslovnica or any other Slavic language in your speech. This term is called accent integrity. Firstly I will introduce a term of a dependency structure:

\textit{Dependency structure\index{dependency structure}} is a prepositional construction or a collocation.

That means, that this abstract term expands the term of collocation by involving prepositional into itself. 

\textit{Accent integrity\index{accent integrity}} is a property of a dependency structure to unify elements of this structure with only one accent on the main word.

What does this definition say? If we have a collocation\index{collocation} or a prepositional construction and we want to pronounce it, we should pronounce dependent words without any accent and put an accent on the first word of the structure. Look at the examples.

\textbf{Examples:}

\textit{Pod něbom} \textipa{['pod nIbom ]} - Under the sky

Surely, you should remember that this might be applied only for brief structures, most often with one dependent word (or a preposition) of one or two syllables. If we have a long dependent word or there are too many dependent words in the construction, we pronounce them with a proper accent on each of the structure elements.

\textbf{Examples:}

\textit{Pod sïnïm něbom} \textipa{[p@d 'sinim 'nIbom ]} - Under the blue sky
