\section{Reported speech}

There are some ways of describing person’s speech in the sentence. The first way is to use direct speech. Look at the examples:

\textit{I say: “We need to go to the theatre”.} - (in quotes is situated my own phrase about going to the theatre)

\textit{- Come on, we need to go!, - exclaimed his brother.} - (after the hyphen we see a phrase of somebody’s brother).

Another way is to use a reported speech - a way of describing what somebody has said without using of quotes. Look at the examples of reported speech in English.

\textit{He says (that) we’re going to stay here today.} (We just mention what HE says to us).

\textit{I said that we had finished this work the day before.} (I mention my words that I said previously without exact reproducing them).

Reported speech is used when we refer to person’s speech in our sentence implicitly. It is constructed with the ordinary sentence describing real situation and then a relative cause of a reported speech with reference to another expression, which is connected to the main clause with the relative pronoun or a subordinative conjunction.

However, like English, Novoslovnica has a tense-shift in using reported speech. You can see what tenses shift to which one in the next table:

\begin{table}
	\begin{tabular}{ll}
		Tense in Direct Speech & Tense in Reported Speech \\
		Present Common & Present Common/Aorist \\
		Present Concrete & Aorist/Imperfect \\
		Future I & Future-in-the-Past I \\
		Future II & Future-in-the-Past II \\
		Future-in-the-Past I & Future-in-the-Past I \\
		Future-in-the-Past II & Future-in-the-Past II \\
		Aorist & Plusquamperfect (aorist part.) \\
		Imperfect & Plusquamperfect (imperfect part.) \\
		Perfect & Plusquamperfect \\
		Plusquamperfect & Plusquamperfect 
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}


Subjunctive mood is reproduced in reported speech so as it is written in the direct one. 

Examples:


Imperative mood is reproduced in reported speech with using modal verbs and subjunctive mood of the main verb.

Examples:

Inferential mood can be reproduced in reported speech doubly: with using modal analogs of the English verb “might” with a tense-shifted verb in Indicative mood or the verb in Inferential mood itself can be tense-shifted (we shift the tense of the auxiliary verb “ïmáti”).

Examples:
