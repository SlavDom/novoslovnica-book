There are different words that cannot be alternated. The biggest class of such words is adverb. It unites a number of groups adverbs can be divided into.

First of all, you should know that adverbs\index{adverb} can be divided into three types, depending on the form they have: \textit{primary} (P), \textit{secondary} (S) and \textit{derivative} (D). When we speak about adverb groups, these letters will be written next to the adverb to help you easier differentiate these types.

\underline{Primary\index{adverb!primary}} adverbs have been formed long ago and we study it as a whole word, without an easy-found root.

\textbf{Examples:}

\textit{Nyne} - Now

\textit{Dy} - When

\textit{De} - Where

\underline{Secondary\index{adverb!secondary}} adverbs have been formed from two words (or a phrase) or from a frozen word form. 

\textbf{Examples:}

\textit{Vdomu} - At home

\textit{Nazad} - Backwards

\underline{Derivative\index{adverb!derivative}} adverbs have been shifted semantically from an adjective. It is the most common type of adverbs. This form usually corresponds with -LY adverbs in English.

\textbf{Examples:}

\textit{Hlådno} - Cold, Coldly

\textit{Věčno} - Eternally

Now let us talk about groups of adverbs. One distinguishes two main types of adverbs: \textit{Significant} and \textit{Demonstrative} \cite{belorussian}. Significant adverbs names concrete property or process attributes, while demonstrative adverbs only refer to these attributes or have an indication of the common nature.

\subsection{Degrees of comparison}

Likewise adjectives, adverbs have three degrees of comparison\index{comparison}. Moreover, there are synthetic and analytic forms too. 

Remember (look at paragraph about adjective degrees of comparison), that there are three degrees: positive, comparative and superlative.

\textbf{Synthetic forms}

Comparative\index{comparison!synthetic} form is made by adding to the word base the suffix “ěǐ’. Unlike adjectives, this is the only suffix to create a comparative form (compare with suffixes “ëǐ”, “aǐ” for hard and soft bases in adjectives). 

\underline{Examples:}

\textit{Mnogo - Množěǐ}

\textit{Sïnë - Sïněǐ}

Superlative form is made so as it is in adjectives - adding a prefix “naǐ-” to the comparative form.

\textbf{Analytic forms}

Analytic\index{comparison!analytic} forms provide simple ways of creating comparative and superlative forms without modifying the word itself. There are two types of adverb analytic comparison.

\textbf{Using prefixes}

Comparative form is created by adding prefix “po-” through a defis ro a positive form. Superlative form is created by adding prefix “naǐ-” through a defis to the positive form.

\underline{Examples:}

\textit{Mnogo - po-mnogo - naǐ-mnogo}

\textbf{Using an auxiliary adverb}

To the positive form you should add an auxiliary adverb in comparative or superlative form.

\begin{table}[!htb]
	\caption{Auxiliary adverb for analytic comparison}
	\begin{tabular}{lll}
		Auxiliary adverb
		& Comparative form
		& Superlative form \\
		more & bolěǐ & naǐbolěǐ \\
		less & mëněǐ & naǐmëněǐ \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\underline{Examples:}

\textit{Mnogo - bolěǐ mnogo - naǐbolěǐ mnogo}

You can use both synthetic and analytic forms at the same time.
